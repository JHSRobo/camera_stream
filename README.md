# Raspberry Pi Cameras

This repository contains the sliver of software that runs on Jesuit Robotics' Cameras, as well as the docs, CAD files, and build guide for their creation. This repository is the first step down a longer path on which Jesuit hopes to open source a majority of its software, hardware, and documentation.

## What is in this repository?
There are 3 scripts that comprise all the code. They're tiny (~80 lines between all three).

There are also 3 pieces of documentation.

* [build_guide.md](build_guide.md) includes the directions for building our camera modules.
* [camera_flash.md](camera_flash.md) is like a supplement to build_guide.md with directions for setting up the camera software.
* [structure.md](structure.md) explains the way that our camera software works and communicates with our camera viewer.

And the .step files for our camera housings in the [cad_files](cad_files)
 folder.
